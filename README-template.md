## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS (flexbox; position: relative)

### Continued development

The positioning of .card-image makes it difficult to adjust the padding-top or margin-top of .card-text. Refactoring the layout or using a more flexible approach (e.g., CSS Grid or Flexbox) could resolve this issue.
